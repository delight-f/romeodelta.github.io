## Why did I start this?

When I was studying for various prehospital and retrieval medical examinations, I could not find any single resource that was helpful. For emergency medicine, [Life in the Fast Lane](www.litfl.com) is excellent. For anaesthetics and intensive care, [Deranged Physiology](derangedphsyiology.com) is similarly well-respected.

So, I am trying to create a similar resource - a 'one-stop-shop' that will help students of the discipline, across the world, to study for these exams.


## Why the name?

When I was a part of [EMICS](emics.org.uk), my East Midlands Ambulance Service callsign was Romeo Delta 78. The 'RD' stands for 'Response Doctor'. This is my small tribute to the great work EMICS does every day.
